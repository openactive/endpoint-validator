## Installation

You need to have `npm` installed (it comes with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```sh
npm install
```


## Running

During development, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Which enables some development tools.

In production, run:

```sh
npm start
```

These commands (unless configured otherwise) start a web server at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Building

To build static page (for e.g. GitHub pages), run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Which creates build directory /dist. This can then be moved to the gh-pages branch
